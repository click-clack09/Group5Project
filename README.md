Project Name: LifeHub

Name of your team: Team Cinco

Created by: Elias Heistand, Yash Kapoor, Donny Moore, Marvin Moore, Richard Maldonado (Team Leader)

LifeHub is a multi-user, all-in-one, planner, organizer, agenda, and calendar. Designed to accomodate different styles of use, LifeHub includes templates for eduacational, business, and personal users. Each template provides different emphasis on specific features used most often by the user type. 

-Educational Hubs allow the user to add classes, to do lists for each class, view a daily calendar, and navigate to individual class pages to access archived notes and a class specific to do list.

-Business Hubs give the user a single to do list, daily and weekly calendar, archived notes, and a global contacts list.

-Personal Hubs are the most simply, with archived note, multiple to do lists and archived notes.

-All Hubs have access to a monthly calendar which displays all of the user's HubEvents. 

Since our users are not one-size-fits-all, each user can have multiple LifeHubs within their account, allowing them to take advantage of all the templates as they see fit.  

Known bugs: The top navigation bar is not functional at this time, but these functions are available through the buttons on the user interface.

Login info: LifeHub emplements a backend MySQL database which must be installed on the end-user's machine. While the program will load the login page, login is not possible without a database connection.

Versions or other requirements: As stated above, a MySQL database must be used to log into LifeHub.
